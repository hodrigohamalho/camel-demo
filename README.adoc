= Camel Demo

This is a simple demo that consist in two parts. 

. The first one using **Camel with Quarkus** does not describe a real use case but focuses in show some main core concepts of Camel and how easy it enables to create cloud-native integrations.

. The second one is based on an event-driven architecture scenario where we create a Telegram chatbot using **Camel-K**. 
It interacts with the user via a chatbot in Telegram and also publishes the messages on a Kafka topic.

== Visual Studio Code Plugins

During the demo Visual Studio Code will be the IDE in use, with the following plugins:

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.apache-camel-extension-pack[Extension Pack for Apache Camel]
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-quarkus[Quarkus Plugin]

== Camel Quarkus

This first part demo will explore some Camel fundamental concepts:

. Bootstrap a Camel Quarkus project
. Using Camel Components
. Using Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs)
. Converting data types

This is the use case that we are going to explore

image::imgs/route-diagram.jpeg[]

Generate two objects using the time component, filter them using the Content-Base Router EIP, and log them to the console. The objects that have the item object equals `ActiveMQ` transform it to `JSON` and save it in the filesystem using the file component. The Order object with the attribute `item` equals `Camel` we transform to `XML` and save in the filesystem.

Let's generate the project using the Quarkus Bootstrap website.

Download a quarkus project using the https://code.quarkus.redhat.com[Quarkus bootstrap], select the followings extensions:

. camel-quarkus-timer
. camel-quarkus-log
. camel-quarkus-bean
. camel-quarkus-file
. camel-quarkus-core
. camel-quarkus-jackson
. camel-quarkus-jacksonxml

After click on **Generate your application** button, and download the zip. After, unzip it and run the project to see if everything is ok with your environment.

    ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev

You also have the option to use the https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling[Quarkus CLI].

Fine, if everything it's fine let's create our first Camel Route.

A Camel Route is a class that extends `RouteBuilder` and implements the configure method. Create a new java class and extends it from `RouteBuilder` and in the `configure` method, start with the code below:

    from("timer:live-demo")
        .log("Hello router!");

This code is using the timer component, with all default configurations, it will be executed in a forever the message *Hello router!"* in the console in a specific frequency.

Components are the key of Camel. They are flexible and reusable  "libraries" that abstract complex operations making it trivial, boosting developer productivity!

https://camel.apache.org/components/latest[Take a look at the camel components, window="_blank"]

Now, let's use some parameters with timer component to repeat *only 2 times*

    from("timer:generate?repeatCount=2)
        .log("Hello router!");

More parameters can be used adding the & as a query parameter.

Think of Camel as a pipeline that transports things *from* someplace to *another one*, and this message body flows through the pipes.

Camel’s syntax is inspired by the UNIX pipeline. In UNIX, we might execute something like `ps -fe | grep foo`. When we run this command, the output of the `ps` command becomes the input to the `grep` command. We “pipe” the output of one command into the input of another command.

Camel chains these actions together in an object called an `Exchange`, which consists of an input message (called the “In” message), some sort of processor (like a component, for instance) and possibly an output or “Out” message if the processor is meant to provide a synchronous response.

A series of `Exchange` state changes creates a Camel Route.

Take some time and take a look at https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/7.4/html/apache_camel_development_guide/basicprinciples[this documentation] to understand better how the Camel pipeline works.

Change the `application.properties` file with your Telegram credentials.

Create the secret in Openshift

    cd camel-k
    oc create secret generic telegram-bot --from-file application.properties

RUN

    kamel run Telegram.java --dev --config secret:telegram-bot

    from("telegram:bots")
        .log("command received ${body}")
        .convertBodyTo(String.class)
        .choice()
            .when(simple("${body} == 'joke'"))
                .log("action joke triggered")
                .to("http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random")
                .unmarshal().json(JsonLibrary.Jackson)
                .transform(simple("${body[value][joke]}"))
                .to("telegram:bots")
            .when(simple("${body} == 'publish'"))
                .log("action publish triggered")
            .otherwise()
                .setBody().simple("Action not found. Supported actions:\n*joke\n*publish")
                .to("telegram:bots");

Add publish to Kafka 

in the application.properties, add:
    
    camel.component.kafka.brokers = my-cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092

oc delete secret telegram-bot
oc create secret generic telegram-bot --from-file application.properties

== Camel Quarkus Demo 

Create the `HelloRouter.java` class. Explore the fundamentals of Camel building this example in a step by step approach

    from("timer:hello?repeatCount=3&period=5000")
        .log("welcome to the camel world")
        .bean(OrderService.class, "generateOrder")
        .log("order generated: ${body}")
        .choice()
            .when(simple("${body.item} == 'Camel'"))
                .log("Processing a Camel Book")
                .marshal().json()
                .to("file:/tmp/live-demo/camel?fileName=camel-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.json")
            .otherwise()
                .log("Processing an ActiveMQ book")
                .marshal().jacksonxml()
                .to("file:/tmp/live-demo/activemq?fileName=activemq-${date:now:yyyy-MM-dd-HHmmssSSS}.xml");

There are several things happening here: 

. Usage of multiple components (timer, log, file)
. How to use parameters
. Bean Invocation 
. Integration Patterns (CBR)
. Data Transformation to XML and JSON

To run the integration use:

    ./mvnw compile quarkus:dev

Explore the dev console: http://localhost:8080/q/dev/


=== Deploy in Openshift
